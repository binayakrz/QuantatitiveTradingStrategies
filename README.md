Day 1: Web Scraping NEPSE Data
In Day 1, we focused on building a web scraper to extract stock data from merolagani.com using Python and Selenium. The key steps included:

Setting up Selenium with ChromeDriver for automating the browser.
Implementing a web scraper to collect stock data like Date, LTP, Volume, Turnover, and more.
Iterating through multiple pages of stock data.
Saving the scraped data into CSV format for future analysis.
Sorting the data by Date for better usability.
This sets the foundation for analyzing historical stock trends in the Nepalese market as we progress toward more complex models.
